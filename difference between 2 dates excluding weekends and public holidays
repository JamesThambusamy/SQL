---we are going to solve a very important business use case where we need to find difference between 2 dates excluding weekends and public holidays  . Basically we need to find business days between 2 given dates using SQL. 
--script:
create table tickets
(
ticket_id varchar(10),
create_date date,
resolved_date date
);
delete from tickets;
insert into tickets values
(1,'2022-08-01','2022-08-03')
,(2,'2022-08-01','2022-08-12')
,(3,'2022-08-01','2022-08-16');
create table holidays

delete from holidays;
insert into holidays values
('2022-08-02','Rakhi'),('2022-08-12','Independence day');
